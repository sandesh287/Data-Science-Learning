MODEL PERFORMANCE REPORT
========================

1. California Housing Dataset (Regression)
------------------------------------------
Model Used: Linear Regression
Evaluation Metric: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

MSE: 0.6589

The Linear Regression model performs well due to the linear
relationship between income, house age, rooms, and house value.



2. Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Classification)
------------------------------------------------
Model Used: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Accuracy: 0.7300
F1 Score: 0.5091

The KNN model captures customer similarity patterns effectively,
especially after feature scaling.

Conclusion:
-----------
Linear Regression was best suited for housing price prediction,
while KNN provided reasonable churn classification performance.
